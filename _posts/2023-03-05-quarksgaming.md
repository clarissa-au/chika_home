I have been gaming from at least Primary 6 in primary school - so I can sorta say that I've played quite a few games and have a little bit of experience in gaming.

*The genre I most like* - Space, Sandbox, Colony Sims, Rhythm Games

*Some gaming skills* - Game server management, building ingame factories

*Playing Style* - Support/Defensive/Reactive

*Alias that I use* - Chika, Yvonne, Rinko - if you see accounts from these names they may be Clarissa's testing accounts!

*The most played game* - Minecraft logging at at least 2000+ hours - Minecraft is one of the first game I play.

*Games that I still play a lot of*
* Minecraft
* Elite Dangerous
* No Man Sky
