Chika here again, spending 2 hours to clean the mess of yesterday.

**Day 2a: Failed Nether Expedition, jumping for slimes**

From the information given by the Administration, TNT duping for farm is prohibited in the main world, but is allowed in the Resource World. Therefore, all the Autonomous Farms must be done in the Resource World.

On the topic of brewing, Chika unsuccessfully went to the Nether and died numerous times. /tpr is a good thing, but Chika needs that Swamp biome in order to make the slime farm, which is the prerequisite to many types of farm. 

I spent 5 hours to this point.
