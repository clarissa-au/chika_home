Chika here again, worked out the Nether.

## Successful Containment of a Blaze Spawner

According to instructions on this video - [Tutorial by ShulkerCraft](tab:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7mGXe5dCHA) - I built the Containment Structure around that Blaze Spawner another player told me the coordinates to, and built the Blaze Semiautonomous Farm. 

I have made only one change to the tutorial - to *not* do the vines. It has been successfully cross-tested on other servers that project KIRAMEKI have presence in, and the blazes (or you) loves to break the vines anyway, and having vines do not actually add too much to the production of the Farm; so I removed the vines.

Chika's target is to now get some slime, fill up my 13/1 bookshelf, get one or two more farms, and wait for the regulations to relax (or dig obsidian for monies) to build the shop proper.

I spent 10 hours to this point.
