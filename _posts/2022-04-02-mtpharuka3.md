While working on the Nether Part of things, Chika found a strange interaction: The Essentials plugin was buying cactus at a rate of $10/block, which is ludicrous.

## Big Cactus Farm

So the design for cactus farm is extremely simple: cactus cactuses, and that cactus will get broken by fences up 1 block and sideways 1 block (this is important), therefore dropping cactus. One block of cactus will get us 2.3 cactus ($23) per hour, so: if we make 4347 cactus plant that cactuses we will get $100k/h, which is a acceptable rate for getting a good 20*20*15 plot in the Main World.

## How do we get 4347 cactus plant that cactuses

    3rt(4347) ~ 16.32

It's awfully close to 16, therefore Chika does so:

    4347 = 16 x 16 x ?
    ? ~ 16.9 \= 17

Therefore Chika need 16 rows and 16 columns of 17 level of cactus that cactuses.

## Shopping List:
    
    4352 cactuses (68s0)
    4352 sand (68s0)
    ~3k wood logs (46s56)
    ~20k slabs (312s32)
    ...

I immediately noted that this is a extreme investment so I'm going to make a 3 layered 10*10 test of a cactus farm first.

## Revised Shopping List - again from Shulkercraft

    1k slab
    800 glass
    300 cactus
    300 sand
    270 fence
    120 gates
    7 hopper
    10 chest
    some water
    some temp blks

It's *13* hours till this point.
