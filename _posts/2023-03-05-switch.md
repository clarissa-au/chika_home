> If only there is a self hosted Bear version.

Clarissa here. If you don't know - this blog is maintained by a girl who has her own server infrastructure.

There is not a point to make - this is originally a space for me to write something - for writing down those items that, in the future may help me or any Minecraft server admins further down the road, as some sort of a logbook for me. Therefore - the website was designed only to be *enough* - without the bloat that is wordpress - without any payment stuff using Ghost - just me and my words and words that *might* be useful for the next traveller and the next sysadmin.

Thank you Annabelle for pointing out that the original Bear Blog is down somewhere in the past week - the option for custom domains and stuff have been removed on the free version of Bear. Although - even though the main point of the blog is to document words - at the end of the day I still wants my own blog on my own domain (on my own server if preferable).

Therefore - this Blog will be transferred onto a Jekyll page on Github Pages. Although - the words will remain the same.
